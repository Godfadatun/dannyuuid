# dannyuuid.js

This is a simple cdn i built after searching all of the internet for code or plugin that could get you your device details using javascript anyway i found this 
npm package from https://github.com/biggora/device-uuid/

he really helped me out so i decided to convert it into a cdn so we can all use it on the fly without any node_modules
